# Todo List

This repository is based on the `To-do List` example found in the book
`Elixir in Action` by Saša Jurić. However, it uses the Elixir 1.4 Registry
(through hex package [reg_helper](https://hex.pm/packages/reg_helper) to
persist the state of processes (even after a kill). `Elixir in Action` uses
a database to this end.
